## API Keys
This website uses 2 APIs, OpenWeatherAPI and Google Map API. In order to run the website locally on your machine, you need to set up the API keys respectively. \
Once you get the API keys, go to `.env_sample` and change the variable to respective API keys. Change the file name to `.env` for the environment variables to work.
